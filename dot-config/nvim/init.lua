-- INFO: introduction
-- this is a minimal neovim configuration written in lua. this is not meant to
-- be a distribution, but rather a template for you to build upon and/or a
-- reference for how to configure neovim using lua in the latest version.
--
-- TUTOR:
-- if you're completely new to neovim and/or vim, consider going through
-- `:Tutor` inside neovim to get a basic idea of how it works.
--     if you don't know what this means, type the following:
--       - <escape key>
--       - :
--       - Tutor
--       - <enter key>
--
-- LUA:
-- some level of familiarity with lua/programming languages are also expected.
-- if you're new to lua, consider going through the official reference:
--    https://www.lua.org/manual
-- or a more friendly tutorial like:
--    https://learnxinyminutes.com/docs/lua/
-- you can also check out `:h lua-guide` inside neovim for a neovim-specific
-- lua guide.
--
-- DEPENDENCIES:
-- this configuration assumes you have the following tools installed on your
-- system:
--    `git` - for vim builtin package manager. (see `:h vim.pack`)
--    `ripgrep` - for fuzzy finding
--    clipboard tool: xclip/xsel/win32yank - for clipboard sharing between OS and neovim (see `h: clipboard-tool`)
--    a nerdfont (ensure the terminal running neovim is using it)
-- run `:checkhealth` inside neovim to see if your system is missing anything.
--
-- MINIMAL:
-- to say that something is 'minimal' you have to define what variable you're
-- minimizing. this configuration minimizes for lines of code and concepts.
-- to some, this configuration may have too many plugins. for example, using
-- mason.nvim to manage lsp servers will be an unnecessary dependency if the
-- user is already familiar with lsps and is comfortable managing them through
-- their OS package manager. but to someone that isn't familiar with lsp servers
-- this approach wouldn't cover everything needed to have the 'minimum' necessary
-- for lsp + completion + fuzzy finding. to some, fuzzy finding is also a bloated
-- dependency.
-- this configuration is only a starting point/reference. it is expected that
-- the user will change the configuration to suit their needs.


-- INFO: options
-- these change the default neovim behaviours using the 'vim.opt' API.
-- see `:h vim.opt` for more details.
-- run `:h '{option_name}'` to see what they do and what values they can take.
-- for example, `:h 'number'` for `vim.opt.number`.

-- set <space> as the leader key
-- must happen before plugins are loaded (otherwise wrong leader will be used)
vim.g.mapleader = " "
vim.g.maplocalleader = " "

-- enable true color support
vim.opt.termguicolors = true

-- make line numbers default
vim.opt.number = true
vim.opt.relativenumber = true

-- enable mouse mode, can be useful for resizing splits

-- sync clipboard between OS and neovim.
--  remove this option if you want your OS clipboard to remain independent.
--  see `:help 'clipboard'`
vim.opt.clipboard = "unnamedplus"

-- save undo history
vim.opt.undofile = true

-- keep signcolumn on by default
vim.opt.signcolumn = "yes"

-- enable live preview of substitutions
vim.opt.inccommand = "split"

-- show which line your cursor is on
vim.opt.cursorline = true

-- set highlight on search, but clear on pressing <Esc> in normal mode
vim.opt.hlsearch = true

-- enable break indent
vim.opt.breakindent = true

-- enable line wrapping
vim.opt.wrap = true

-- formatting
vim.opt.tabstop = 2

vim.cmd.colorscheme("gruvbox")

-- INFO: plugins
-- we install plugins with neovim's builtin package manager: vim.pack
-- and then enable/configure them by calling their setup functions.
--
-- (see `:h vim.pack` for more details on how it works)
-- you can press `gx` on any of the plugin urls below to open them in your
-- browser and check out their documentation and functionality.
-- alternatively, you can run `:h {plugin-name}` to read their documentation.
--
-- plugins are then loaded and configured with a call to `setup` functions
-- provided by each plugin. this is not a rule of neovim but rather a convention
-- followed by the community.
-- these setup calls take a table as an agument and their expected contents can
-- vary wildly. refer to each plugin's documentation for details.

-- INFO: formatting and syntax highlighting

-- equivalent to :TSUpdate
require("nvim-treesitter.install").update("all")

require("nvim-treesitter").setup({
  auto_install = true, -- autoinstall languages that are not installed yet
})
